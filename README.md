# Intonize

A Flutter app that helps you practice and improve your intonation on your instrument. üéª

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This app is still under development (v0.0.1) ‚ö†Ô∏è


## How it works
1. Plug your headphones in and set the volume just right so that you can still hear your instrument. üéß
2. Practice your piece slowly. Note for note.
3. The app will detect the note you're playing and play the same note in tune in your headphones.
4. Listen carefully and only move on to the next note once your current note is perfectly in tune with the sound in your headphones.
5. Do this multiple times. This is a very effective way to improve your intonation.

## Useful tips
- Read the gauge to see whether you're playing too high or too low. If the pointer is pointing at the white section, then you're playing in tune.
- Tap the üéπ icon to change the sound.
